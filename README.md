# 🧠 AI-Powered Tic Tac Toe Game (Minimax Algorithm)

This is a beginner project I explored to understand how Artificial Intelligence works in games.

## 🔍 What I Did:
- Learned the Minimax algorithm for making optimal moves
- Explored Python code for AI-based decision making
- Customized parts of the code to improve gameplay feel

## 🛠️ Custom Changes:
- Modified printed messages
- Added game restart option (in progress)
- Personalized the output UI (emoji-based version coming)

## 💡 What I Learned:
- How the AI predicts user moves using Minimax logic
- Recursive thinking and game-tree structure
- Basics of project structure and GitHub usage
